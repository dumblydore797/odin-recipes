        <ol class="steps">
            <li id="highlight">Begin by browning and crumbling the ground meat in a skillet. Add the onion and cook until translucent. 
                Then, incorporate the canned tomato products along with half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.</li>

            <li class="normal">While the sauce simmers, boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they reach al dente consistency.</li>

            <li id="highlight">Create the cheese layer by combining cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, 
                the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl.</li>

            <li class="normal">Assemble the lasagna by layering the ingredients as directed in the recipe—begin with a sauce layer and conclude with mozzarella.</li>

            <li id="highlight">Once assembled, cover the lasagna with foil and bake in the preheated oven for approximately 30 minutes. 
                Then, remove the foil and continue baking until the top develops a golden-brown hue.</li>
