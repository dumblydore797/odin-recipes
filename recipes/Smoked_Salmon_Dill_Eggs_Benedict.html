        <ol>
            <li>To craft this culinary masterpiece, start by blending softened butter with aromatic fresh dill, a hint of lemon zest, and a touch of cayenne pepper for a subtle kick. 
                This dill-infused butter becomes the hero of our dish, adding a burst of herbaceous goodness to each bite.</li>

            <li>Next, prepare the eggs with care. Poaching them to perfection is an art - the whites should be firm yet yielding, and the yolks thickened but irresistibly runny. Each egg is gently lifted from the simmering water and carefully placed atop a buttered English muffin half.</li>

            <li>Layer on the star of the show: slices of premium smoked salmon. 
                The silky, smoky flavor of the salmon complements the richness of the poached egg, creating a harmonious blend of tastes.</li>

            <li>Finally, season with a sprinkle of cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper to enhance the ensemble. 
                Garnish with a fresh dill sprig for a pop of color and herbaceous freshness.</li>

            <li>Indulge in this luxurious brunch creation - a feast for the senses that promises to elevate your morning routine and leave you craving more. 
                Serve with a side of sunshine and a cup of your favorite morning brew for the ultimate breakfast experience.</li>
