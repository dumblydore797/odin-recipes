        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) and grease a baking dish with cooking spray.</li>

            <li>In a small bowl, blend together soy sauce, brown sugar, minced garlic, and grated ginger. 
                Arrange the salmon fillets in the prepared baking dish, skin side down, and generously pour the teriyaki sauce over them.</li>

            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the salmon easily flakes with a fork, about 12 to 15 minutes.</li>

            <li>To assemble, scoop rice into serving bowls and top with the cooked salmon. 
                Drizzle over the flavorful teriyaki sauce from the baking dish. Sprinkle over shredded red cabbage, grated carrots, and sliced radishes for a burst of color and crunch. 
                Finish with a garnish of sliced green onions and sesame seeds to add an extra touch of flavor and visual appeal.</li>
        </ol>
